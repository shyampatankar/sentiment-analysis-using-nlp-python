I cannot begin to explain my disappointment and frustration with OLA. I have multiple times tried to book a ride that seem to be cheapish then for it to take at least 5mins for someone to accept. Most of the times I lose patience and click cancel ride then I still get charged $10-$17 without even getting a ride. Ola is terrible and a scam. NEVER USE OLA

Ola advertise 5km for $5.00 what a ripoff from my house to the air port is 4.7 km. The Ola driver arrived
at my house the proceeded to take a long route(a route I have neve used). this route then proved to be in excess of 7km for which I was charged My wfe and i questioned the driver as to where he was going but we were ignored. To top it all the driver was driving at about 80 km/hr in a 50 zone. The nett result is, I will not use Ola again and bad mouth them at any opportunity I get. I emailed Ola about a week ago to voice my concerns, they have yet to show me the courtesy of a reply. A RIPOFF

Price tripled unexpectedly, support unhelpful
Tried to ride ola today, there was a coupon available for a cheap ride.
After i arrived, the price hiked up suddenly 3x the price.
I contacted customer support thinking that this was outrageous, and they refused to help me --- citing that i agreed to the price when I placed my order. Unhelpful, expensive lies.

If you have to use ola, Take a screenshot of your order when you place it. I'm never riding again

Deceptive drivers and bad support.
The driver first called me asking me to walk from the pickup point to meet him where he was. when i refused as I had several bags with me he did come. He then started following the gps suggested route as agreed.

We were on the highway and ant the very last second he veered off the road onto the offramp. I then checked with him if he was all right, making such an abrupt move at 100kmh took me by complete surprise! he said yes and that the gps seemed to change at the last second. I suggested we return to the highway and he agreed but instead of doing so continued to drive away from the highway into the back streets, slowly zigzagging his way towards my house. at this point he was completely ignoring the gps.

Once we got back to a major road approaching a traffic light the light changed to yellow, we were very close and could have comfortably made it though. instead he chose to brake abruptly sending my possessions onto the floor and prompting the car behind us to beep in frustration.

After getting home my fair was sent to me and was 31% higher than quoted! I tried to follow this up with Ola but I cant find any way of actually getting in contact with someone. Only a support system telling me thanks for your feedback, the case is now closed.

First ride was $5.60
First ride was $5.60. Then after went to the same place twice and got charged 3 times the amount of the first. It's all lies, the coupons are lies and they take the longest route so that you get charged more. Therefore, the price and km estimates when you book are void because this is a scam 100%. NZ should ditch Ola.

I was quoted £15 for a ride and they took £43 from my bank account!! They are refusing to refund me because 'their system won't allow them to do it' and just make it incredibly difficult to speak with them - going around in circles.

Ola rip off
Well, after several times using Ola without a problem I suddenly had one of the issues that a lot of other people here have been complaining about. In my case the fare at the end of the ride was suddenly 2.5 times the estimate that had been provided and double the most expensive I have ever paid for a trip that I do regularly. No explanation. The trip took no longer than normal.
The worst thing is that Ola deliberately make it almost impossible to make contact with them. And by the way, if your ride was 2 days old or more - there is no ability to get it put right.
And by the way - the email address listed for Ola below? Don't bother with it - it doesn't exist.
Ola will be one app that is coming off my phone.

Worst experience ever
Worst experience ever, I had due of 500rs, they have been calling continuously for the payment clearance I told that I have tested covid positive and my family too once I get rid of that i will come back to them. But this buggers calling me in the early morning 3 30am even after informing. I am not getting sleep even my bro after that call. Is this is how they behave to customers. I need back my all money until today how much paid for them. Worst experience ever.

Ola team
Ola team, this is for your information that your company people who drive the the car don't know how to behave with girls. The name of the person is Khalid Hussain and CRN number was 5353054801...on the full day of the ride he threatened me for giving 800 INR instead of 450 INR while booking the cab the amount was shown to me as 450 INR and when I reached my destination also he threatened me and used abusive language with me so that I can get fear of him and handover the amount of 800 INR. Also I asked to Police for help !!
I request you to avoid such kind of mental people from your company and hire people who know how to treat with their customer.

Do Not travel with Ola. No customer service and charging weird fees risky driving skills and unhygienic drivers.
First of all, I was charged exponentially big amount than I supposed to be paying. Delhi airport to Ajmer where my house is 387KM but the OLA magically increased it to 487KM, and charged me INR 11009 which is a lot because I travel from ajmer to Delhi airport IT CAN NEVER BE 487, so OLA APP is Deformed and they are making fool out of people.

Then the driver had CNG ISSUES in his car he took me two different gas stations where he couldn’t find the CNG but we waited 40 minutes just at gas station(CNG). He said you will get your money back in your OLA ACCOUNT.

The cab itself was a flop show the OLA APP gave false promises that your cab will be with luxury features I could hardly sit in there my luggage was on the backseat and it’s a CNG CAR SO NO POINT I CAN KEEP MY LUGGAGE IN THE DIGGI.
OlA SHOLD NOT FORCE TRAVELLER TO HAVE SIT IN THE CNG CARS IF ITS OUTSTATION AND CHARGING STUPID FEES.

the meter at the beginning of the trip showed
meter reading : 214661km
Trip end reading: 215048KM
If you do math it’s : 387km

BUT OLA math said it’s 487KM they added 100km extra from somewhere no one knows.
I was charged for extra time. First of all the driver ran out of CNG and made we wait 40 minutes each time every time he took me to different different CNG stations.


It was the most pathetic experience I have ever had in traveling with OLA.
Since the beginning the driver had no clue what he was doing.
The cab stunk like tobacco as the driver was kept eating and the whole messed up.
The car dint have AC and the driver kept the windows open till the whole trip. I asked him to turn it down but he dint turn the AC on.



I just want to know why that happened. For sure this was my last and final trip with OLA ever and I will spread the word so no one should travel with OLA.
I want to be called by OLA and solve this issue. Give me my money back.

Cheap & Cheerful Lies! Uber is more reliable
Cheap and cheerful is far from the truth!
Ola is possibly worse than Uber! I booked a car for a 0.99 mile journey (3mins drive from where I was) at £3-£4 which confirmed my driver was 3mins away, waited 4-5mins still no car. Went back onto the app but the car was no longer there, I didn’t want to book again as I didn’t want to be charged for 2 bookings. I used my other phone which showed the price for an Ola was £3-£4 for the same journey. While in the process of booking the price suddenly jumped up to £7-£12!!! How disgusting! I had no choice as it was pouring with rain and I’m also pregnant! I explained to the driver who was also appalled by the price! I then checked again on my other phone to see that my original driver cancelled and the price had gone down back to £3-£4! The customer service is terrible as you can’t actually communicate with anyone... You get a generic computer response as to why you've been charged that price. The hygiene of the drivers is unprofessional, the cars are always filthy and a lot of them drive like they haven’t even had a driving test.

THIEVES! The absolute worst service I have ever received
The absolute worst service I have ever received doesn’t even deserve 1*, waited 15 mins only for my driver cancel last minute and I got charged for the ride! Upon calling customer service they claimed it was because I “refused to wear a face mask” when I hadn’t even met the driver!!! He never arrived at the pick up point! Explained the situation further and told them he never got to my location and this is an absolute lie! I get cabs every day and I’m always wearing a mask. They were absolutely useless and claimed “the system does not allow” them to process a refund! Very very frustrating. Spoke to about 5 different people including managers and they all repeated the same thing like robots. Ended up getting robbed of my money and wasted a whole lot of time and energy, never using this trash service again! They reduce their customers to 0 and are absolute thieves.

Do not bother
Do not bother yourself. Don’t waste any space on your phone for this absolute bullshyte app. Every time I placed an order for a cab I would be left waiting 10 minutes or more then the driver cancels. Some times you don’t even get a notification telling you your driver has cancelled.

OLA! The cab company where the customer is always wrong
I booked an Ola cab home with my child and the driver cancelled saying I was not wearing a face mask yet the driver never came to me. The second ride I booked the driver pulled up into the middle of the road blew his horn aggressively and tried to get me to come out into the road while holding a bags, a baby and a scooter. My issue was resolved in real time. I have been trying MONTHS to resolve this with several texts requesting payments for rides I DID NOT TAKE. Today Ola has charged £15 onto my card. No apology a £15 voucher that disappeared on a £3 ride. Who do I complain to?

I was charge too much and my discount did not go through- I raised the issue online or in the app but there is no reply- it seems no one care especially as a new customer.
Poor service, promotion and discount do not apply as it is advertise or posted - I am not very happy with this particular new cab service or you call it OLA.

Don’t bother, get Uber
Don’t bother. Stay with Uber. There App is currently acting up and taking drivers the long way. You can’t complain because when you call it tells you to complain in the app but when you do it tells you the fair is correct. My driver went on the motor way and added an extra 8 mins to my journey. Tried to sort it out and can’t because of the app and the ‘24’ hour service line that doesn’t support customers. I have been billed about £8 more than normal bare in mind this is my normal route. Won’t be using you again if this is what you plan to do to customers I rely on taxis too much for you to be overpricing for no reason.

Extremely poor service
Extremely poor service. Initially the wait time will show 4 mins and once booked it keeps increasing. You end up waiting for more then 15 mins and the routes provided to the drivers and the longest possible one so that they can make more money. When you try telling the drivers the shorter route they don't want to even listen they tell you they are following the map.

The price keeps increasing as well firstly they will show u a lower price and when you try book it will fail to connect and then the next min it's has increased to double the the price and sometimes even more.

You guys really need to work on you service and the conduct of drivers. It's pathetic.

Extremely poor customer service
If I could give this company zero stars I would. Avoid this company at all costs. I booked a journey but the driver cancelled the ride. I then booked a second driver, was collected and dropped off at my destination. I then realised that I had been charged for the cancelled journey. I called the customer service to discuss this and was advised that the driver cancelled the journey because I was not following covid regulations. I was wearing a mask so I am really not sure why the driver cancelled the journey. Also if I were not following covid regulations why did my journey with the second driver go ahead? I asked the Ola customer service representative for a refund, which he refused to do instead he advised as a goodwill gesture he will put a voucher on my account. I am really struggling to understand how this can be deemed as an acceptable resolution and classed as a goodwill gesture given that the error was on their part. I then asked to speak to a manager. I was advised some-one will call me within 4-6 hours. This did not take place. I called back the next day and was advised some-one will call me within an hour. This callback also didn't take place. I then called customer services the following day and was advised some-one will call me back soon. I think it is very clear to see that their customer service is pretty poor. I would even go so far as to say that it is non-existent. I am now getting a refund through my bank and will be speaking to a local trading officer about my experience. How is this company even in business? Again avoid this company at all costs.

The worst customer service I have ever had
The worst customer service I have ever received. I was dropped off at the incorrect location and charged for the trip. It is not possible to lodge this sort of complaint via the app and I needed to send an email. I was told I was charged the correct fare. When I disputed this email, I received the same copy and paste response as their last email. No refund or further investigation or explanation. Uber on the other hand would have refunded the trip immediately. Would never use this company again and I strongly recommend that you don't either!

Ola have tried to take me for a fool
Ola have tried to take me for a fool. I do not recommend this app at all, the customer 'care' team on the phone and via email have been absolutely terrible too and have robbed me of my money!!

this saga began as the driver who accepted my ride drove past me as I waited at my location/ designated pick up point off the main road. Where i was, and the address in the app was all correct and matched.

I waited patiently with my mask on in the freezing cold and feeling extremely fatigued as I literally saw the driver go past me. (All of this is recorded via GPS on the app)
I messaged the driver telling him he went past me, and to please turn around to pick me up at the correct place.
The driver messaged back saying he can't pick up on a main road - however, i was not on a main road and neither was the pick up point. This did response made no sense.
Instead of simply turning around, the driver cancelled my ride charging me a £6 fee for 'violating covid-regulations'. this action is petty, clearly the driver didn't take my basic request for the actual service I am paying for: of picking me up where i was!

I phoned the 'customer care' line which was a complete waste of time. The 'advisor' refused to refund my money or even take me seriously, gaslighting me by telling me i was 'breaking covid violations'. I literally had a mask on as i waited at the EXACT spot the driver was to pick me up from. Instead of doing the right thing and refunding me, the 'advisor' talked about how the 'system won't allow a refund' which is clearly a lie - then he sent me a £6 voucher code expiring within a month! This is not the same as putting the money you have stolen out of my bank account under false grounds! I also said i had no plans to take another ola within the next month, (or ever again lets be honest!) resulting in the voucher being of no use whatsoever!

I then emailed this complaint to their 'customer care' team- which has been another fiasco. Fobbing me off and refusing to refund me, or even take my complaint seriously. I replied, asking them to describe their 'evidence' of their made up false accusation of me not 'following covid regulations' and i also asked them to check the app GPS to see the proof of the driver literally driving past me and not being at the pick up point.
Predictably, i have not received a reply to this email. I have sent 2 subsequent follow up and have heard nothing back. They are ignoring my complaint.

I was waiting, on a street corner at night, heavily fatigued and i just wanted to get home. I can't take public transport due to the health risks and travel bans, and OLA has no sense of service or moral compass.
